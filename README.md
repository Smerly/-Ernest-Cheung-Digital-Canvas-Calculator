 -Ernest-Cheung-Digital-Canvas-Calculator


Hi! Welcome to my Digital Canvas Calculator! For anyone that does Digital Painting this is self explanatory, but for those who don't heres the rundown on the purpose of this calculator! Basically, it changes the measurement unit of your canvas without actually changing how big the canvas this. The way is does that is by using the DPI to change from inches to pixel and pixels to inches.

STEPS:

1. Enter your name (for fun!)
2. Enter your canvas's DPI
3. Type either 1 or 2 to select whether you want to convert from inches to pixels or pixels to inches. 
4. Type in the unit of your choice and get your answer!
